# ACS_Website
This repo is meant to hold current and past versions of the Student Members of the American Chemical Society at the Univertsity of Michigan Website!

~~Currently this site is not attached to any domain name, so it can only run locally.~~
Set up to run through Github Pages as a temporary hosting site. Soon to be hosted through HostGator since UofM refused to host our site :(


## TO DO:

* ~~Format Workshops page to include pagination holding all available workshops, details, and slides~~
* ~~Formate Events page to include calendar with all currently scheduled events, possibly hooked up to google calendar?~~
* ~~Design Home page to include relevant information, links, etc~~
* ~~Add social media links other than this repo~~
* ~~Add link to email list~~ or GroupMe somewhere
* ~~Add member bios to about page~~
* ~~Add mission statement~~
* Add upcoming event flyers

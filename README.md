# ACS_Website
This repo is meant to hold current and past versions of the Student Members of the American Chemical Society Website!

I've never used Git, Github, HTML, or CSS before, so to say this will be a work in progress is to say the least.

Currently this site is not attached to any domain name, so it can only run locally.


## TO DO:
* Format Workshops page to include pagination holding all available workshops, details, and slides
* Formate Events page to include calendar with all currently scheduled events, possibly hooked up to google calendar?
* Design Home page to include relevant information, links, etc
* Add social media links other than this repo
* Add link to email list or GroupMe somewhere

### Changelog:
2/22/24:
  Formatted About page, added page titles, navbar, headers, temp images
2/23/24:
  Updated logo on header
